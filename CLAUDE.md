## MCP Servers

- **DeepWiki** - AI-powered documentation for any GitHub repository
- **Exa** - Web search and code context retrieval

## Project Setup

Before starting any new project or documentation:

1. **Always initialize a git repo first:**
   ```bash
   mkdir my-project && cd my-project
   git init
   ```
   Or clone an existing repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
   cd repo
   ```

2. **Why?** Git commits automatically sync your work to Databricks Workspace at `/Workspace/Users/{your-email}/projects/{project-name}/`

3. **Then start working** - your commits will be backed up to Workspace

## Quick Start

- Projects sync to Databricks Workspace on git commit
- Use `/commit` for guided commits
- Ask "help me create a dashboard" to see skills in action
- Ask about any GitHub repo with DeepWiki MCP
